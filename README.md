The code, collected dataset, and experimental results of this paper can be accessed from the following URL: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HBSdaSHyJarW_DakSo-xgWZXghO2m-Ml. We will continue to update this website for ongoing improvements.

# In the supplementary PDF document, we have focused on presenting the following content:
1. Demonstrated knowledge pertaining to tensor algebra.
2. Added denoising experiments on the BSD68 dataset to validate the effectiveness of the weighted tensor nuclear norm regularization term in suppressing iamge noise.
3. Showcased the solution process of our model.
4. Included the latest experimental results of low-light image enhancement methods as of November 2023.
5. Displayed ablation experiments of our model.
6. Presented the experimental outcomes of two methods, SRRR and LR3M, which are effective in noise reduction but have limited capability in preserving image details.
